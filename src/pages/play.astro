      FHC Theatre presents Arthur Miller's powerful drama, The Crucible â€“ a gripping tale of integrity, courage, and the dangerous power of mass hysteria. Set in 1692 Salem, Massachusetts, this
      timeless masterpiece follows John Proctor and his community as accusations of witchcraft tear their town apart. When fear and suspicion replace reason and justice, ordinary people must make
      extraordinary choices about what they believe and what they're willing to sacrifice for truth. Our talented student actors bring Miller's unforgettable characters to life in this intense drama
      that explores themes as relevant today as they were in Puritan New England. Witness the struggle between individual conscience and social pressure in one of American theatre's greatest plays. A
      story of moral courage that will leave you questioning: What would you do when everything you hold dear is at stake?
